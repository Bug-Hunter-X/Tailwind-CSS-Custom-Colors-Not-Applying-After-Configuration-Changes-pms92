# Tailwind CSS Custom Colors Not Applying

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where custom colors fail to apply correctly after significant changes to the configuration file. The bug is tricky to debug due to the intricate nature of Tailwind's styling system.  The solution involves carefully reviewing the `content` array for correct file paths and ensuring consistency in the `theme` object.

## Bug Description

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Try to modify the `tailwind.config.js` to add or change a custom color. 
4. Observe that the custom color does not apply to the element in `index.html`.

## Solution
The solution provided demonstrates how to correctly specify paths in the content array and ensure consistency in color definitions.
